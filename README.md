# MovieListingAPI
The goal of this capstone project is to develop a movie listing API using FastAPI. The API will allow users to list movies, view listed movies, rate them, and add comments. The application will be secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that only the user who listed a movie can edit it. The application should be hosted to a cloud platform.
